coPsi
=================================

**Stellar rotation, inclination, and orientation**

coPsi is made to derive stellar rotation periods from photometric light curves, then *properly* calculate the stellar inclination, and ultimately measure the obliquity :math:`\psi` through:

.. math::
   \cos \psi = \sin i_\star \sin i_{\rm o} \cos \lambda + \cos i_\star \cos i_{\rm o} \, ,

where :math:`i_\star` is the stellar inclination, :math:`i_{\rm o}` is the orbital inclination, and :math:`\lambda` is the projected obliquity.
